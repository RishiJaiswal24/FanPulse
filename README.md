💡 Use **Razorpay Test Mode** with UPI ID `test@razorpay` to simulate payments.  
⚠️ *FanPulseDev is only for testing dynamic content and interface behavior — it cannot receive money.*  

If you want to test payments yourself, generate your own Razorpay test credentials (`key_id` and `key_secret`) by following this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/qbS_AFSUze4?si=wjKYcCqjwK6QF5Uz).
